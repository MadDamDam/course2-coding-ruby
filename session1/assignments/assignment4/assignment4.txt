Write a rake task called "archive". the task will perform the following:

- Archive all files in a specified path (default path is "." ) to "tar.gz".
- The new archive name should be the "folder_name.tar.gz" (change all spcaes,hyphens and other non word characters to "_")
- The location of the "folder_name.tar.gz" file will be located at "<the folder path>/build/folder_name.tar.gz"
- Task should receive two parameters:
  1. A parameter called PATH - this parameter should tell rake where to perform the above actions (default ".").
  2. A parameter called EXCLUDE - This is a comman seprated list of sffixes that the task should ignore and NOT archive.
  
  
An example:

Calling the command "rake archive PATH=/home/user/my_archive EXCLUDE=.tmp,.bkp" will perform the following:

1. Create a file "/home/user/my_archive/build/my_archive.tar.gz
2. File will not include all files that end with .tmp & .bkp.

Code submbmittion:

1. Be placed in "Solutions" folder at "session1/solutions/".
2. Please submit the code in a single "Rakefile"
3. Code should Create a Pull request (Go to Moodle for guidlines for forking the project + creating a pull. Found under "coding" section)
